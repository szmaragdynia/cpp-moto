# Task for Motorola Academy
I was accepted to next recruitment stage (team work), however, I could not find time for full-time course in back May and had to decline at that stage.

# Task
Given an user-specified amount of fence available (integer), find three sides of rectangle (integers as well), which would result in maximum area of the rectangle. 
The fourth wall is infinitely long - meaning that I can assume any value.
