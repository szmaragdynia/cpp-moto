# Task for Motorola Academy
I was accepted to the next recruitment stage (teamwork), however, I could not find time-slots for full-time course back in May 2022 (due to Univeristy classes this semester. Next year is OK with time).

# Task
Given an user-specified amount of fence available (integer), find three sides of rectangle (integers as well), which would result in maximum area of the rectangle. 
The fourth wall is infinitely long - meaning that I can assume any value.
