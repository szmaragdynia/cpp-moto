# Why do I code?

Because I absolutely love problem-solving. Tackling with issues, difficulties just puts me in a right, happy place.
Coding also feels like an act of creation - I love that. I love creating stuff (not that I am any kind of good at it, but just coming up with ideas feels good).
This being said, I have to add that coding is obviously not the only way in which one can engage in problem-solving or creative activities. There are lots of interesting issues to chase in the world, and ways to create...but unfortunately(?) not many of them can actually transform themselves into a job. 
And since time spent in a job is a big part of one's life, I want this big part of my life to be focused around the areas which allure me, and as I said before, "put me in a right place". By this I mean the mental space, attitude, etc. This just feels right.
